### [Fundamental Matrix - Epipolar Geometry.](https://github.com/DanileRond/Computer-Vision-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/CV_fundamental_matrix_Navarrete.ipynb)
In this practical work we will address the problem of estimating the fundamental matrix between two images. To do this, the characteristic points will be detected in both images and then, correspondences between points will be established. Using these correspondences, the fundamental matrix can be estimated.


### [Interesting points and Correspondences.](https://github.com/DanileRond/Computer-Vision-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/CVDL_Correspondences_Navarrete.ipynb)
This lab will address the issue of finding interesting points and establishing correspondences between them for two similar images (for example, a stereo pair, two images captured to create a panorama, etc.). We are going to detect characteristic points in both images and then establish the correspondences between the detected points. We will use different methods to detect characteristic points:

Harris corner detector
SIFT
SuperPoints

### [Line detection.](https://github.com/DanileRond/Computer-Vision-with-Deep-Learning/blob/main/CVDL_Lines_1_Navarrete.ipynb)
This practical work has two objectives: first, to analyze the operation of some low-level algorithms. Second, to use these tools to solve practical problems.
